Advent of code in Haskell lts-10.4

Remember that benchmarks aren't perfect, and can vary between runs for a variety
of reasons. I use them to see which days I need to optimize,
not gather absolute data on.

    Slowest (in seconds):

    - Day 15 10.1
    - Day 25  9.3
    - Day 22  7.3
    - Day 24   2.9
    - All others finish under a second
