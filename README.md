Advent of code in Haskell lts-10.4

Remember that benchmarks aren't perfect, and can vary between runs for a variety
of reasons. I use them to see which days I need to optimize,
not gather absolute data on. For example, when my laptop isn't plugged
in the benchmarked times double. (day 15 takes 10s etc).

Report generated by running
`stack build && stack exec advent-code --output report.html`

```
Day 15 - 5.8
Day 25 - 3.9
Day 22 - 3.3
Day 24 - 1.7
All others in less than a second
