Advent of code in Haskell lts-10.4

Remember that benchmarks aren't perfect, and can vary between runs for a variety
of reasons. I use them to see which days I need to optimize,
not gather absolute data on.

    Slowest (in seconds):

    - Day 15 5.4
    - Day 25 5.4
    - Day 22 5.2
    - Day 24  1.7
    - All others finish under a second
