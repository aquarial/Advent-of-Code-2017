# advent-of-kotlin

The messiest kotlin solutions for http://adventofcode.com/2015 and http://adventofcode.com/2016

Runnable kotlin code to solve last years advent. Each file is written for part 2. Minor
to major changes required to make them work for part 1.

2016 Day 22 part 2 is the only part I couldn't fully automate. I ended up printing the
nodes in a format I could trace a potentially optimal route through. I got it on my second guess.
